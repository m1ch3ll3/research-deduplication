### Background concepts

It may be useful to be familiar with these concepts in order to be able to understand some of the literature:

* [Partially Ordered Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set)
* [Lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order))
* [Semilattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semilattice)


### Terms

There is an [IPFS Glossary](https://github.com/ipfs/glossary), a work in progress, which should have definitions for terms used in CRDT. If you are consistently running into terms that you do not know the meaning of, please open an issue on that repository and we can work on a definition that will help you (and others!) going forward.
